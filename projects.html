            <h2>Micromechanics of deformation and damage in materials</h2>
        <p>This work focuses on the the fundamental mechanics of deformation at micrometer scale. This could be scale of fibre diameter in case of fibre reinforced composites, grain scale in case of granular materials or grain scale in case of additively manufactured materials. There are two sub projects currently in progress.

                    <strong>Micromechanics of additively manufactured copper components</strong> Additively manufactured copper components can develop porosity, potential defects due to manufacturing process and environment. Our current work is exploring the quality of copper produced and ways to optimise the manufacturing parameters. Watch this space for further details.

                    <strong>Micromechanics of multi material additive manufacturing</strong> We are aiming to additively manufacture components that are made of multiple materials. Current work is investigating the mechanical integrity as well as microstructural information of such components.

            <h2>Generative AI in predicting deformation and damage in materials</h2>
        <p>The work in this strand is at nascent stage. The emphasis is on the development of generative models to predict crack propagation in materials. More information to follow. </p>
