         <h1>Micromechanics of Materials and Manufacture research group</h1>
            <p>
                We are a interdisciplinary group with varied skills from mechanical engineering, material science, design and manufacture. Our focus is on the understanding of micromechanics of deformation and damage. Please see details on our current projects and recent news. If you are intered to join us, you can explore potential opportunities, existing and future and do feel free to get in touch.

                    <strong>Experimental work</strong> Our primary mode of working is through experiments and there is interest and expertise in developing customised experimental test set ups. We use x-ray and neutron imaging to investigate the characteristics of materials and mechanics at micrometer length scales. Further details on experimental facilities will be updated shortly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Numerical modelling</strong> We predomiantly use open source software and Python code for processing of data and for numerical modelling.
