                The focus of research in my group, Micromechanics of Materials and Manufacture research group, is to relate micromechanics of deformation and damage in material and manufactured components with its macroscopic mechanical behaviour. We are interested in a wide variety of materials ranging from coal, polymers and biomaterials to metals. With additive maufacturing, the traditional approach to characterisation of materials and manufacture has changed as these two aspects got intertwined. The work in my research groups intends to build a better understanding of the mechanical characteristics of the final product in terms of the starting materials. Recently, we have been very exploring the application of generative AI in material characterisation. Further information on the current and past projects is available in the Research group pages.
