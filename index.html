                The focus of my research is to relate micromechanics of deformation and damage in material with its macroscopic mechanical behaviour. I do this by relating the mechanics at different length scales inferred through observations from physical experiments and numerical modelling.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Micromechanics of damage in materials:</strong> This work focuses on the the fundamental mechanics of deformation at micrometer scale. This could be scale of fibre diameter in case of fibre reinforced composites, grain scale in case of granular materials or grain scale in case of additively manufactured materials.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Generative AI in material behaviour</strong> The work in this strand is at nascent stage. The emphasis is on the development of generative models to predict crack propagation in materials.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Digital twins</strong> This strand of work focuses on the development of digital twin for additive manufacturing process.
